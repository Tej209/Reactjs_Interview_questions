## TL;DR

In React, `state` is a local data storage that is managed within a component and can change over time, while `props` are read-only attributes passed from a parent component to a child component. State is used for data that changes within a component, whereas props are used to pass data and event handlers to child components.

## What is the difference between state and props in React?

### State

State is a built-in object in React components that holds data or information about the component. It is managed within the component and can change over time, usually in response to user actions or network responses. When the state changes, the component re-renders to reflect the new state.

- State is local to the component and cannot be accessed or modified outside of it
- State can be initialized in the constructor of a class component or using the `useState` hook in a functional component
- State changes are asynchronous and should be done using the `setState` method in class components or the updater function returned by `useState` in functional components

Example of state in a class component:

```jsx
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      count: 0,
    };
  }

  increment = () => {
    this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
  };

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>Count: {this.state.count}</p>
        <button onClick={this.increment}>Increment</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

Example of state in a functional component:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Props

Props (short for properties) are read-only attributes passed from a parent component to a child component. They are used to pass data and event handlers down the component tree.

**Key characteristics of props:**

1. **Props work like function arguments** - They are used to pass data to components
2. **Props are read-only** - They cannot be changed by the child component
3. **Main purpose** - To pass data from parent to child component
4. **Props are basically objects** - All props are combined into a single object
5. **Children prop** - If you pass data between opening and closing tags, it becomes the `children` prop

**Example with your code:**

```jsx
function Greeting(props) {
    return <h1>Hello! {props.name}</h1>;
}

function App() {
    return (
        <div>
            <Greeting name="Ashish" />
            <Greeting name="Teju" />
        </div>
    );
}

export default App;
```

**Understanding the `children` prop:**

```jsx
function Card({ children, title }) {
    return (
        <div className="card">
            <h2>{title}</h2>
            {children} {/* This renders whatever is between <Card></Card> tags */}
        </div>
    );
}

function App() {
    return (
        <Card title="My Card">
            <p>This content becomes the children prop</p>
            <button>Click me</button>
        </Card>
    );
}
```

Example of props in a class component:

```jsx
class ParentComponent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <ChildComponent message="Hello, World!" />;
  }
}

class ChildComponent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <p>{this.props.message}</p>;
  }
}
```

Example of props in a functional component:

```jsx
function ParentComponent() {
  return <ChildComponent message="Hello, World!" />;
}

function ChildComponent(props) {
  return <p>{props.message}</p>;
}
```

### Key differences

- State is managed within the component, while props are passed from a parent component
- State can change over time, while props are immutable
- State is used for data that changes within a component, while props are used to pass data and event handlers to child components
