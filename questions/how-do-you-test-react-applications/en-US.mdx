title: How do you test React applications?

## TL;DR

To test React applications, you can use tools like Jest and React Testing Library. Jest is a JavaScript testing framework that works well with React, and React Testing Library provides utilities to test React components in a way that resembles how users interact with them. You can write unit tests for individual components, integration tests for component interactions, and end-to-end tests using tools like Cypress.

## How do you test React applications?

### Unit testing

Unit testing involves testing individual components in isolation. Jest is a popular choice for unit testing React applications. It provides a test runner, assertion library, and mocking capabilities.

#### Example

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import '@testing-library/jest-dom/extend-expect';
import MyComponent from './MyComponent';

test('renders the component with the correct text', () => {
  render(<MyComponent />);
  expect(screen.getByText('Hello, World!')).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

### Integration testing

Integration testing involves testing the interaction between multiple components. React Testing Library is useful for this as it allows you to render components and interact with them as a user would.

#### Example

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { render, fireEvent, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import '@testing-library/jest-dom/extend-expect';
import ParentComponent from './ParentComponent';

test('updates child component when parent state changes', () => {
  render(<ParentComponent />);
  fireEvent.click(screen.getByText('Update Child'));
  expect(screen.getByText('Child Updated')).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

### End-to-end testing

End-to-end (E2E) testing involves testing the entire application flow from the user's perspective. Cypress is a popular tool for E2E testing in React applications.

#### Example

```javascript
describe('My Application', () => {
  it('should allow a user to log in', () => {
    cy.visit('/login');
    cy.get('input[name="username"]').type('user');
    cy.get('input[name="password"]').type('password');
    cy.get('button[type="submit"]').click();
    cy.url().should('include', '/dashboard');
  });
});
```

### Snapshot testing

Snapshot testing involves capturing the rendered output of a component and comparing it to a saved snapshot. Jest provides built-in support for snapshot testing.

#### Example

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import renderer from 'react-test-renderer';
import MyComponent from './MyComponent';

test('matches the snapshot', () => {
  const tree = renderer.create(<MyComponent />).toJSON();
  expect(tree).toMatchSnapshot();
});
```
